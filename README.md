# Personalised and Customised-ToDo-List
Project submission for 30 Days of Kotlin by Google Developers
This project is inspired and created with the help of Lessons taught in Codelabs Platform of this 30 Days of Kotlin Program. A
Kotlin Bootcamp for Beginners gave a great insight about Kotlin Programming language, keeping those fundamentals in mind taking next step towards Android Kotlin Fundamentals Course gave me an insight on how we can create amazingly interactive android applications.

## Project Description:   
This project application is a Personalised and Customised ToDo list that not only takes the tasks we have to do but also has some interactive elements like Quotes, psychology of colors etc. So, if you are up for some some fun and play you can download this application and run it on your mobiles. You can also modify the tasks according to your needs.

## Project Implementation:  
My project is basically divided into three parts one is the Quote Of The Day activity in which I have implemented the basic interactivity with the button as whenever you click the button a new quote for the day is generated, the second part of my application is the Color of the day which is basically a game motivated from color psychology that is when the user chooses the color a suitable text that the color signifies appears and corresponding to that text an image is displayed. The third part of my application is the tabbed activity where I have created two tabbed activity by creating two fragments and then implementing the SectionsPagerAdapter Kotlin class and PlaceHolderFragment. At last after the user selects whatever he has to do for the day he clicks on the checkbox and at the end the fab button is clicked which says you have do these tasks for the day. 

These are the following concepts that I have used in my project: 
1) Chaging the Launcher Icon using adding Image Set and added animation 
2) Basic Interactivity with a Button using random function
3) Implemented the concept of Constraint Layout using Layout Editor in an interesting manner
4) Implemented a Tabbed Activity with Two Tabs 
5) Created a Fragment 
6) Created a card view with image view and checkbox as container 
7) Used the FAB (Floating Action button) to perform toast actions
